Before we get to MainWindow.xaml we forgot to do some modifications


1-Style:
__________
When we press "Forgot Password?"
The background color changes to white-blue this typically because the focus/click template.. can we make the background transparent for this button and any other Text-Type Button within LoginWindow.xaml please

Also any clickable button within LoginWindow.xaml set its cursor to Hand


Now lets go for input Fields.. 
Instead of creating input field everytime in every page we move to.. we will set it as a template inside if UserControls folder give it a name of InputField and will set some asking attributes as same as in FirstButton.xaml
Such as:
Icon (will be using mahapps icons "packetmaterialkind", i have installed it slready from Nuget) = (default = Account)
ZoomEffect =True/False (Default= True} (as same as FirstButton *I don't remember what was the input variable name whether it is ZoomEffect or ZoomAnimation or something else.. make sure to make SecondButton has the same Attribute name that activates ZoomAnimation as in FirstButton)
GlowEffect =True/False (Default = True)
GlowColor (Default= {staticresources = AccentColor / AccentBrush})
Cursor (Default= Hand)
Color (Default = {StaticResources=FontNormal /FontNormalBrush} )  (this attribute controls only the Foreground color which typically will change the Icon color only)

we have 2 main issues
First one: When input field whether <password> or <Textbox> when we click them or when they are focused.. they display border with a color.. can we cancel that and make all input fields focus to be none

Second one: place holder.. is very very bad actually, you set a text block within the input field that can be selected or copied or cut or deleted.. i need it to be "editable = none".. please fix this to be a true place holder with foreground={staticresources FontNormalBrush}


Now next step is animations:

Input fields:
____________
When the user click password field for example.. we need to animate password-word placeholder location from within the input field to top corner if the input lol field and please focus on doing this very small detail ( there is a borderbrush with border weight= 1.. what we need to do is to move Password [Which is the placeholder word] to top corner above or on top of border line and reduce placeholder size just a little bit so it look perfectly aligned with the border line.. covers border line behind it and animate it to be very eye candy such as using ease or specific animation timeline)


Also when the user hover over the input field i want to create secondary border line that do this animation [ from bottom center of input field a line start growing left side and right side in same time.. until it fills the whole bottom width of the input and the goes up to fill the height of input field.. and goes back to fill the top width of the input field with animation speed of 2 sec..and when the border surrounds the entire input field it will glow with the same way we did for Firstbutton Glowing effect.. and giving it glowing color if white, ]
